**User:** John D., 43, software engineer, Chicago townhouse

**Call started:** 10:02 AM EST

**John:** "Hey, thanks for taking my call! So, this EcoGro app... sounds pretty cool."

**Me:** "Thanks for joining, John! Absolutely, tell me what you think."

**John:** "I'm a total plant newbie, but my wife LOVES herbs. Problem is, our townhouse gets like, zero sunlight."

**Me:** (makes mental note: sunlight pain point) "Hmm, I understand. Does EcoGro help with limited light situations?"

**John:** "Not sure yet, but the app itself looks slick. I like the plant pics and badges for growing stuff."

**Me:** "Glad you think so! We wanted it to be fun and engaging."

**John:** "Okay, so back to my no-sun problem. Can it still suggest stuff I can grow?"

**Me:** "We offer personalized recommendations, but sunlight is definitely a factor. I can check with the team..."

**John:** "Awesome! Listen, my wife would probably flip for a pre-made herb kit. Like, starter stuff that's already picked out."

**Me:** (eyes widen) "Interesting! We haven't explored that yet, but it's a great idea. We could partner with plant suppliers..."

**John:** "Exactly! Imagine, pre-potted, ready-to-grow herbs, customized for our sad, dark townhouse... she'd be ecstatic."

**Me:** "John, you might be onto something revolutionary here. Let me run this by the product team, see if it's feasible."

**John:** (laughs) "Revolutionize my wife's herb garden? Sounds good to me. But seriously, keep me updated, I'm genuinely interested."

**Me:** "Absolutely! Speaking of updates, any other feedback on the app itself?"

**John:** "Honestly, just more plant variety would be great. And maybe some tips for brown thumbs like me... like, what NOT to do?"

**Me:** "Noted! We're constantly adding new plants, and beginner guides are definitely on the roadmap."

**John:** "Sounds good. Hey, one last thing: my wife loves sharing stuff on social media. Could EcoGro integrate with that somehow?"

**Me:** (scribbles furiously) "Another fantastic suggestion! Sharing successes and connecting with other plant lovers... that could be huge."

**John:** "Right? Okay, gotta run, but keep me in the loop, Plant Whisperer!"

**Me:** (chuckles) "Will do, John! Thanks for the invaluable feedback. Talk soon."

**Call ended:** 10:32 AM EST
