Email subject: Issue with account setup

**Juan**:

Hello,

I recently signed up for your new web app and I'm excited to start using it. However, I'm encountering some issues with setting up my account. Whenever I try to log in, it says my credentials are incorrect, even though I'm certain I'm entering the correct information. Can you please assist me with this?

Thanks, Juan

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your assistance. I've been trying to log in via the web app using my laptop. When I attempt to log in, it just says "Invalid username or password" without any error codes. I've tried resetting my password multiple times, but the issue persists.

Looking forward to your guidance on resolving this.

Best regards, Juan

Hi Juan,

Thank you for the additional information. It's helpful to know that you're using the web app on your laptop.

Since you've already tried resetting your password without success, let's try a different approach. Could you please try logging in using a different web browser or an incognito/private browsing window? Sometimes browser cache or cookies can cause login issues, and this step might help us narrow down the problem.

Please give this a try and let me know if you're still encountering the same issue. We'll proceed from there based on your response.

Best regards, Sarah

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the suggestion. I just tried logging in using a different browser, and I'm still getting the same "Invalid username or password" message. It seems like the issue persists despite changing browsers.

Do you have any other recommendations for troubleshooting? I'm eager to get started with using the app.

Best regards, Juan

Hi Juan,

Thank you for trying that step. Since changing browsers didn't resolve the issue, let's delve deeper into troubleshooting.

Could you please confirm if you're able to successfully log in to your account using the mobile app? This will help us determine if the problem is isolated to the web app or if it's account-related.

Additionally, if you're comfortable with it, I could initiate a manual password reset for your account on my end. This might help bypass any potential technical glitches with the automated password reset process.

Looking forward to your response so we can move forward with resolving this issue for you.

Best regards, Sarah
