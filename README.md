<p align="center"><b>Web application providing an intuitive interface to databases.</b></p>
<hr/>

Mathesar is an open source software project to help users store, organize, visualize, and collaborate on data. Our goal is to provide an intuitive user experience for non-technical users. Mathesar directly operates on PostgreSQL databases, which gives it the flexibility to be interoperable with thousands of other existing tools and applications.

Potential use cases for Mathesar include publishing and exploring public datasets, running business processes such inventory management and project tracking, providing a ready-made interface for speedy data entry and custom reporting, collecting and processing data from large groups of people, simple data cleaning and analysis, and automatic web API generation.

We started building Mathesar in March 2021 and are making steady progress towards releasing an initial version of the project by spring 2022. Please visit [our public wiki](https://wiki.mathesar.org/) to learn more about the project.
